# Machine-Unlearning

Goal: Remove all traces of data from a machine learning system without affecting its performance.

Rather than deletion of a particular dataset from the training process and rebuilding the model from scratch, utilization of an unlearning algorithm to produce a new model without retraining our model from scratch.
